# Exemplary FPGA Board Setups

**:construction: This page is under construction :construction:**

<!--
This folder provides exemplary NEORV32 SoC setups for specific FPGA boards. You can use one of the setups to directly get started
or you can modify the  .. to build your own setup.
Project maintainers may make pull requests against this repository to add or link their setups.

## Adding Your Project Setup

Please respect the following guide lines if you'd like to add (or link) your setup to the list.

* check out the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* add a link if the board you are using provides online documentation (and/or can be purchased somewhere)
* use the :file_folder: emoji (`:file_folder:`) if the setup is located *in this* folder; use the :earth_africa: emoji (`:earth_africa:`) if it is a link to your local project
* please add a `README` to give some brief information about the setup and a `.gitignore` to keep things clean; take a look at [`arty-a7-35-test-setup`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/boards/arty-a7-35-test-setup) to get some ideas what a project setup might look like
  * for example, add the according [NEORV32 Version](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) or [release](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/releases) you were using to build the setup
* if you like, start a new ":raised_hands: show & tell" [discussion](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/discussions) to show off what you have made
