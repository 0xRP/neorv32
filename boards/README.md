# Exemplary FPGA Board Setups

**:construction: This page is still under construction :construction:**

This folder provides exemplary NEORV32 SoC setups for different FPGA platforms/boards. You can use one of the setups to directly get started
or as a starting point to build your own setup.

Project maintainers may make pull requests against this repository to add or link their setups.

### Adding Your Project Setup

Please respect the following guidelines if you'd like to add (or link) your setup to the list.

* check out the project's [code of conduct](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* add a link if the board you are using provides online documentation (and/or can be purchased somewhere)
* use the :file_folder: emoji (`:file_folder:`) if the setup is located *in this* folder; use the :earth_africa: emoji (`:earth_africa:`) if it is a link to your local project
* please add a `README` to give some brief information about the setup and a `.gitignore` to keep things clean; take a look at [`arty-a7-35-test-setup`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/boards/arty-a7-35-test-setup) to get some ideas what a project setup might look like
* if you like start a new ":raised_hands: show & tell" [discussion](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/discussions) to show off what you have made
