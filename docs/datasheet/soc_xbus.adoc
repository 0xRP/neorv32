|=======================


The external bus interface provides a Wishbone b4-compatible on-chip bus interface that is
implemented if the `XBUS_EN` generic is `true`. This bus interface can be used to attach external memories,
custom hardware accelerators, additional peripheral devices or all other kinds of IP blocks.

The external interface is **not** mapped to a specific address space. Instead, all CPU memory accesses that
do not target a specific (and actually implemented) processor-internal address region (hence, accessing the "void";
see section <<_address_space>>) are redirected to the external bus interface.


**Wishbone Bus Protocol**

The external bus interface either uses the **standard** (also called "classic") Wishbone protocol (default) or
**pipelined** Wishbone protocol. The protocol to be used is configured via the `XBUS_PIPE_MODE` generic:

* If `XBUS_PIPE_MODE` is `false`, all bus control signals including `wb_stb_o` are active and remain stable until the
transfer is acknowledged/terminated.
* If `XBUS_PIPE_MODE` is `true`, all bus control except `xbus_stb_o` are active and remain until the transfer is
acknowledged/terminated. In this case, `xbus_stb_o` is asserted only during the very first bus clock cycle.

|=======================

[WARNING]
If the Wishbone interface is configured to operate in classic/standard mode (`XBUS_PIPE_MODE` = false) a
**sync** RX path (`XBUS_ASYNC_RX` = false) is required for the inter-cycle pause. If `XBUS_ASYNC_RX` is
enabled while `XBUS_PIPE_MODE` is disabled the module will automatically disable the asynchronous RX option.

[TIP]
A detailed description of the implemented Wishbone bus protocol and the according interface signals
can be found in the data sheet "Wishbone B4 - WISHBONE System-on-Chip (SoC) Interconnection
Architecture for Portable IP Cores". A copy of this document can be found in the `docs` folder of this
project.


**Bus Access**

The NEORV32 XBUS interface does not support burst transfers yet, so there is always just a single transfer "in fly".
Hence, the Wishbone `STALL` signal is not implemented. An accessed Wishbone device does not have to respond immediately to a bus
request by sending an ACK. Instead, there is a _time window_ where the device has to acknowledge the transfer. This time window
is configured by the `XBUS_TIMEOUT` generic that defines the maximum time (in clock cycles) a bus access can be pending
before it is automatically terminated with an error condition. If `XBUS_TIMEOUT` is set to zero, the timeout is disabled
and a bus access can take an arbitrary number of cycles to complete (this is not recommended!).

When `XBUS_TIMEOUT` is greater than zero, the Wishbone gateway starts an internal countdown whenever the CPU
accesses an address via the external memory interface. If the accessed device does not acknowledge (via `xbus_ack_i`)
or terminate (via `wb_err_i`) the transfer within `XBUS_TIMEOUT` clock cycles, the bus access is automatically canceled
setting `wb_cyc_o` low again and a CPU load/store/instruction fetch bus access fault exception is raised.


**Bus Endianness**

The NEORV32 CPU and the entire Processor setup use a *little-endian* layout. To allow direct connection
to a big-endian memory system the external bus interface provides an Endianness configuration. The
Endianness of the external memory interface can be configured via the `XBUS_BIG_ENDIAN` generic.
By default, the external memory interface uses little-endian byte-order.

Application software can check the Endianness configuration of the external bus interface via the
SYSINFO module (see section <<_system_configuration_information_memory_sysinfo>> for more information).


**Access Latency**

By default, the XBUS gateway introduces two additional latency cycles: processor-outgoing (`*_o`) and
processor-incoming (`*_i`) signals are fully registered. Thus, any access from the CPU to a processor-external devices
via Wishbone requires 2 additional clock cycles. This can ease timing closure when using large (combinatorial) Wishbone
interconnection networks.

Optionally, the latency of the XBUS gateway can be reduced by removing the input and output register stages.
Enabling the `XBUS_ASYNC_RX` option will remove the input register stage; enabling `XBUS_ASYNC_TX` option will
remove the output register stages. Each enabled option reduces access latency by 1 cycle.

.Output Gating
[NOTE]
All outgoing Wishbone signals use a "gating mechanism" so they only change if there is a actual XBUS transaction being in
progress. This can reduce dynamic switching activity in the external bus system and also simplifies simulation-based
inspection of the Wishbone transactions. Note that this output gating is only available if the output register buffer is not
disabled (`XBUS_ASYNC_TX` = `false`).
